# PS4_Discord
PS4 discord integration

made by Marhau



Alternative to PS4RPD
The application should also be much faster and work in the background, using 21 MB of RAM, while having the ability 
to run checks if Discord is closed. When the PS4 is turned off,
the application will go to sleep mode. That is, it would also sleep when there is no Internet connection.
